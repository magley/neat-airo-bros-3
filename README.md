# neat-airo-bros-3

NEAT Algorithm that plays Super Mario Bros. 3 for the NES.
Inspired by SethBling.

How to run:

- open the BizHawk emulator
- open your legally obtained Super Mario Bros. 3 Rom file
- load the script: `Tools > Lua Console > Open Script > NeatAiro3.lua`
- create a savestate called `SMB3_NeatAiro_lvl3.State` in the same folder `NeatAiro3.lua` is in (do this just once)
